Specifically, we would like to know:\n\n1. Is there any report or panel in the Zerto interface that indicates the active synchronization time for a VPG?\n2. If it is not directly available in the interface, is it possible to obtain this information through the Zerto API? If so, could you provide us with an example of how to make such a query?\n3.

Then on Friday at 1:17pm it turned to a Bitmap Sync and showed 49% (7TB out of 14.1TB). Now it has stayed in a Bitmap sync since then and the percentage that is complete has gone up as high as 854 (11.9TB out of 14.1TB) on Sunday but yet this morning we are at 69% (9.8TB of 14.1TB). We are wanting to know if this VPG from on-prem to Azure is still running and if so why did we go from Initial Sync to Bitmap Sync if it has not finished its Initial Sync.",

At that point, I cancelled the mini-DR test and started investigating and looked at the 2 VRAs that handle our VPGs in Azure.\n\nC1BCDRZTO02 handles the 2 VPGs I mentioned above.  When logging into the Azure VRA, I noticed the Temporary Storage drive (that's typically created when Azure VMs are spun up), was full and the paging file was taking up all but 30MB of the D:\\(Temporary Storage) drive space.\n\nIs there any process that the Zerto VRA may be runn",

We have a vpg that uses our pair of production zvms that is continually flagged by the encryption analyzer as potentially malicious, but we know for a fact that it isn't and always dismiss the alert/warning about it and have since disabled the encryption analyzer due to these constant false flags. Is that what this warning is alluding to? If so, it doesn't make a lot of sense to me that a production zvm that isn't linked to the current nonprod one as a site is preventing it from being upgraded. Any guidance here? Rebuilding the vpg isn't an option since it's a production workload.\n\nThanks,\n\nScott T.",

Along the way, I ran in to the EULA agreement issue with the VRA when i upgraded to 9.7, but I was finally able to run the code and re-install the VRA and get it upgraded and ready.  After that though, it seemed like the VPGs would no longer sync.  They sat in a bitmap state, but no network traffic was taking place.  I thought this may be due to the fact that 9.7 was not a full version on Azure yet, so I went ahead with the migration to 10U2p2.  I ran in to several issues along the way with it, but after going back and trying again from scratch, I found my issue and the migration finally went through.  However, I still have no network traffic at all.   I have checked Azure components over and over again, and can ping the customer site just fine, it just acts like the two sites won't talk no",

I then accessed the appliance's terminal and restarted all pods (option 3), afterwards the GUI did not come back up. I then tried restarting the appliance (optino 4), the GUI still did not come up. I tried option 4 again, still nothing, and option 3 again, still nothing. Logging into the other ZVM in the site-pair, the original ZVM is showing as disconnected and our RPOs are now starting to climb. I did take a VMware snapshot of the ZVM before attempting the upgrade, so I do have that as a last resort, but I'd really like to get this ZVM back online and get it upgraded within our maintenance window. \n\nThanks,\n\nScott T.",

I was on 10.0.2 and decided to update to 10.0.4 and when I went to update it says it could not because of space issue.  Deleted VPG's cleaned logs and still no update.  I decided to just rebuild and now have it rebuilt and had problems with installing VRA's to ESXi host, which took 10 hours because it would just fail, no explanation why.  Now I have VRA's installed on ESXi host and trying to create VPG's and Zerto goes to create VPG and then just disappears no error no just gone.  I need help getting it back to normal so we can just leave it alone until we can remove it permanently.  Need help getting Zerto to a healthy state.",

We proceeded to run some checks and we discovered that we were indeed unable to SSH directly to the host. This was passed back to the customers network and infrastructure team who \"fixed\" this but did not provide any further details. At present, we can SSH to the host using a putty session so we know SSH is working, but the ZVMA is unable to upgrade its VRAs.\n\nAlso, we have seen that since this issue occurred, we have seen the site flick between connected and not with a \"connection between site and the hypervisor manager is down alert\" appearing and disappearing every few seconds.  I don't know if this is related right now but I've put this in the same ticket for now as they occurred at very close to the failed VRA upgrades. If its not related we can split this out. \n\nUnfortunat",

What ends up happening is that without the SQL heartbeat, both servers start trying to assign the same IPs since their trying to failover for each other, creating IP conflicts.\n\nI was wondering if adding a third NIC on the production VMs for those SQL servers, but leaving it unbound without an IP in Windows would be a valid work around for this issue?

So I tried restarting all the pods and another appliance reboot, and now the appliance can no longer connect to its paired site appliance. I've tried another round of restarting the pods and another appliance reboot, but it's still not connecting.

How can we evacute these VPGs to different hosts? Our plan is leave the supported VRA's alone for now until Zerto supports 8.0u3 esxi.",

Now with the appliance we faced that something has changed, and we can't choose to bind the 9071 on the zerto address. SO you can image we had a site disconnection.\nNow the question is how to solve this situation also if not maybe correct, on windows zvm, we could choose the interface that was serving the 9071 port . My workaround has been to set a nat rule \"sudo iptables -I POSTROUTING -d 192.168.211.20 -p tcp --dport 9071 -j SNAT --to-source 10",

I recommend opening a case to confirm if it\u2019s a UI bug, and we can track for our dev team.  _x000D_\n_x000D_\nI did perform a test in my lab where I unchecked the thin provisioning box and resulted in the following error.

The current VM is running Windows Server 2019 and we would like to create a new VM running Window Server 2022. \n\nDurning this process we would like to keep all current Zerto configuration. \n\nWe are a Cloud Service Provider, so we have a lot of ZORG's. Migrating all those settings manually as described in: https://help.zerto.com/kb/000004107 will take a lot of time and making a mistake is reasonable.\n\nIs there a better solution (scripted way and guide) or guide like there is for the ZVM (Zerto Virtual Manager)?\n\nIf there isn't, is it an option to do an in-place guest os update from Windows Server 2019 to Windows Server 2022 for the Zerto Cloud Manager?\n\nThank you in advance.\n\nBest regards,\nSidney Laan\nCloud Engineer at Uniserver\n+31611955481",

The VRA had the wrong IP, and after the upgrade it ended up in an inaccessible state in vCenter. I deleted it from disk, and attempted to install a new VRA, but ran into installation errors at 80% consistently.\n\nThe main error I run into is: VRA installation IP=10.103.83.253. Failed: Install VRA was canceled by timeout(1800)\n\nI have attempted to install the VRA multiple times, but it will get stuck at 80% for hours at times. vCenter has the task \"Reconfigure Cluster\" stuck at 0%, and never finishes. There is one of these tasks for each VRA install attempt I've tried. Some of these tasks were initiated by the Zerto bot, others by my user, but I'm not sure where the distinction between the two is.\n\nI have attached screenshots of our ZVM and vCenter.",

I booted the Windows ZVM back online, and the crashloops stopped and the UI became accessible again. I'm not certain but it appears the Linux ZVMA is using the Windows ZVM's embedded database and not it's own. The database container on the ZVMA is healthy and not crashing during any of this.

For example, if we failed over VMs totalling ~100TB, then hit commit, but then had to fail back to the source site unexpectedly, how long would this take?  \n\nI'm hoping you can have a look at our logs today (testing occurred between 1600-1730 EDT on 9/10/2024) and let us know why one VM appears to be slower than the other.\n\n",

When we fail over some VMs we have seen that some of the VMs/Server come up with their computer name wiped out (inside of Windows). \n\nMy question is how does the failover choose where to pull the computer name from? If for example if netbios has an fqdn in it does that cause issues. I'm looking for documentation or official zerto support to say how all of this computer naming happens.",

After hours of investigation I found the Swagger web interface, but none of the commands there correspond to the encryptionDetection command that the original KB wants me to run. Could you please assist.\n\nGET /v1/encryptionDetection/suspected/vpgs\nPOST /v1/encryptionDetection/dismissEvent\n\nhttps://help.zerto.com/bundle/RN.HTML.10.0_U5/page/release_notes_for_zerto_10_0_update_5.html",

Both ZVMs in the vCenters are paired with each other and both paired to the ZCA in public cloud.\nIf we had a VPG protected from one vCenter to both the other vCenter and to the public cloud ZCA and then failed it over from one vCenter to the other, would this break the public cloud replication, or is Zerto smart enough to reconfigure itself knowing that a VM has moved from one ZVM it is paired to to another? \n\nMy guess is that replication would break because the VM no longer exists in the source vCenter, and the VM that appears in the other vCenter has a new MOREF ID and is seen as a new VM, so we would have to delete the replication to the cloud and re-replicate from the new vcenter, is that assumption correct?",

When I first got on to work with them, they had already uploaded the OVA to their host, but a little ways in I was informed that they had not added a network to it during the upload.  I asked if they had uploaded both the OVA and .SIG files together, and they said no.\n\nSo I had them delete the box and asked them to start from scratch.  Trouble is, when they select both of those files, an error message comes up saying that the OVA file is not a valid template.  If they pick just the OVA file, that goes away, and we can proceed.  But adding in the .sig file causes the error to come up.  There are no further details about what is causing it, just that it is not a valid template.\n\nI had them log in to the zerto website and download the 10.0U2p1 OVA straight from the sight, unzip it and start fresh with it, but we still get the same message.  I have yet to run in to this with any other clients",

We have tried copying this field from a reference VPG but on import it says the Datastore is not found. However, if we manually create the VPG and export the settings, it matches our manually modified JSON.\n\nI am aware of the Zerto Consolidation Tool but that would require us to migrate to the Linux appliance first and appears to do a one for one ZCA to VRA migration.

This is often found in /etc/ssl/ or /etc/httpd/ depending on your setup.\n\n2. Disable 3DES Weak Cipher by modify the configuration by adding !3DES to configuration file:\nFor example:\nSSLProtocol all -SSLv2 -SSLv3 -TLSv1 -TLSv1.1\n SSLCipherSuite HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5:!3DES\nThis configuration disables SSLv2, SSLv3, TLSv1, and TLSv1.1, and removes the 3DES cipher which is associated with the SWEET32 vulnerability.\n\n3.Restart the Service after making these changes.\nsudo systemctl restart httpd\n\nBy restarting httpd service will it affect the VPGs and replications ? \n\nThank You",

So far as I can tell, the issue started \"4 days ago\" according to the alert panel.  It started alerting at 8:17AM UTC on 9/20/24 according to the panel, but that was just for the RPO warning.  There are no existing communications issues on either side.  I am not sure where to go from here, and was hoping we could get the opinion of a tech on it.  We didn't have these issues before we moved over to 10.0U2p2 on the Azure side.  It didn't start on the same day as our migration to 10 though, so I don't know if it correlates with that or not.",
